# Book Search Engine 

## Description
This is a book search engine application that uses Google Books API and allows users to save book searches to the back end. It was originally built with a RESTful API but has been refactored to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. It is a full-stack MERN application with a React front end, MongoDO database, and Node.js/Express.js server.
